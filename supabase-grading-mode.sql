-- ============================================
-- GRADING MODE: Enable cross-user canvas access
-- ============================================
-- This temporarily allows all users to see all canvases
-- for grading/demonstration purposes.
-- 
-- ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: This reduces security for demo purposes only!
--    Restore proper RLS policies after grading is complete.

-- Drop existing restrictive canvas policies

DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can create their own canvases" ON public.canvases;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update their own canvases" ON public.canvases;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can delete their own canvases" ON public.canvases;

-- Create permissive policies for grading mode
CREATE POLICY "grading_mode_view_all_canvases" ON public.canvases
    FOR SELECT USING (true); -- Allow all users to view all canvases

CREATE POLICY "grading_mode_create_canvases" ON public.canvases

    FOR UPDATE USING (true); -- Allow all users to update all canvases

CREATE POLICY "grading_mode_delete_all_canvases" ON public.canvases
    FOR DELETE USING (true); -- Allow all users to delete all canvases

-- Also update shapes policies to allow cross-canvas access
