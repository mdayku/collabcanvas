## Future Roadmap

### **Phase 13: AI Enhancements** (Deferred)

**💬 AI Multi-Turn Clarification System** (6-8 hours)
- **Problem**: AI currently shows error toast for ambiguous commands (e.g., "shrink by 200%")
- **Solution**: Conversational AI that asks clarifying questions and maintains context
- **Implementation**:
  - Conversation state management (store history array)
  - Inline clarification UI (not blocking modal)
  - LLM context integration (resubmit conversation history)
  - Cancel option to abandon conversation
- **Example Flow**:
  ```
  User: "shrink it by 200%"
  AI:   "Did you mean make it 200% larger or reduce to 50% of current size?"
  User: "50% of current size"
  AI:   ✅ Resizes selected shape to 50%
  ```

### **Phase 14: Enterprise Features** (Long-Term)

**🏗️ Project Hierarchy System** (20-30 hours)
- Projects contain multiple canvases
- User permissions (view/comment/edit)
- Email invitation system with roles
- Project dashboard (post-login landing)
- Multi-level permissions (Project → Canvas → Shape)
- Enhanced RLS policies for organizational data

**📚 Version History** (20-30 hours)
- Timeline view of canvas changes
- Restore capability with diff visualization
- Change tracking per user
- Branching and merge functionality

**🗂️ Layers Panel** (10-15 hours)

- Visual layer management
- Lock/hide layers
- Layer grouping and naming

**🔌 Plugin System** (40-60 hours)
- Extension architecture
- Third-party integration API
- Plugin marketplace
- Sandboxed execution environment

### **Phase 15: Meta-UI System** (Innovative, Long-Term)

**🤯 Right-Click Interface Customization**
- **Concept**: Users can modify the application interface itself
- **Core Features**:
  - Toolbar customization (drag & drop sections, add/remove tools)
  - Menu system redesign (edit text, icons, positions)
  - Layout personalization (moveable panels, resizable sections)
  - Workflow optimization (custom shortcuts, macro recording)
- **Business Impact**:
  - User retention through personalization
  - Accessibility (custom interfaces for different needs)
  - Productivity (optimized workflows)
  - Differentiation (interface customization as product feature)
  - Enterprise value (standardized custom interfaces for teams)
