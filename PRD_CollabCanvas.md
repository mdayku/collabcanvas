## Future Roadmap

### **Phase 13: AI Enhancements** (Deferred)

**💬 AI Multi-Turn Clarification System** (6-8 hours)
- **Problem**: AI currently shows error toast for ambiguous commands (e.g., "shrink by 200%")
- **Solution**: Conversational AI that asks clarifying questions and maintains context
- **Implementation**:
  - Conversation state management (store history array)
  - Inline clarification UI (not blocking modal)
  - LLM context integration (resubmit conversation history)
  - Cancel option to abandon conversation
- **Example Flow**:
  ```
  User: "shrink it by 200%"
  AI:   "Did you mean make it 200% larger or reduce to 50% of current size?"
  User: "50% of current size"
  AI:   ✅ Resizes selected shape to 50%
  ```

### **Phase 14: Enterprise Features** (Long-Term)

**🏗️ Project Hierarchy System** (20-30 hours)
- Projects contain multiple canvases
- User permissions (view/comment/edit)

- **Core Features**:
  - Toolbar customization (drag & drop sections, add/remove tools)
  - Menu system redesign (edit text, icons, positions)
  - Layout personalization (moveable panels, resizable sections)
  - Workflow optimization (custom shortcuts, macro recording)
- **Business Impact**:
  - User retention through personalization
